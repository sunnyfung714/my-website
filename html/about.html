            <p>Hi, my name is Maurice Lidman and my background is in boxing. I competed as an amateur in my early years and now like to share my knowledge and expertise as a coach. It is not unknown for me to jump into the ring as your sparring partner.
            <br><br>
            For over three decades Maurice has been involved in the boxing scene. He has competed as an amateur in his early years and now shares his knowledge and expertise as a coach, by running his boxing classes with passion and enthusiasm.
            <br><br>
            The atmosphere in our boxing classes is fun, exciting and highly energised.
            Whether it is your first class or you're an intermediate level boxer, you will gain a lot by becoming involved. It is one of the best cardiovascular workouts available.
            <br><br></p>

            <div class="grid_item_about6">
                <p>We are a family operated business that has little to do with the rest of the fitness industry. Our gym world does not include the annoying telemarketers or membership consultants. Our gyms speak for themselves, our members do our marketing.
                <br><br>
                We believe that word of mouth has way more credibility than something that a marketing machine dreams up.  You are always welcome to look through any of our gyms at your own pace, with no pressure whatsoever.
                <br><br>
                With hard-selling 'health club' sales consultants hustling you on every corner, we pride ourselves on being a refreshing change from that. Our 'no obligation, no pressure' attitude is clearly evident with our $10 CASUAL visit rate.</p>

                <p>We have created gyms that we would love to train in and share that passion and enthusiasm with our valued members. Our gyms have an old school feel with a new school attitude!
                <br><br>
                We are open 24:7. YOU can now train any time you like, weekdays, weekends & public holidays. WE ARE OPEN! Unlike other so called 24:7 gyms, we are staffed all the time. If you need a late night workout, a protein bar or shake, supplements or a cool t-shirt, we are open for you. Our class times change constantly so check out on the web site for the timetable at each of our clubs.</p>
